Mgmt was started by [James](https://purpleidea.com/) in 2013. It grew out of his
extensive experience with earlier automation tools, and his desire to have
something better.

Being a strong believer in [open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html),
James has run the upstream project as a community where everyone is welcome to
participate and contribute, and where newcomers can learn and be mentored.

The [main project page](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is where all the
upstream development happens.
