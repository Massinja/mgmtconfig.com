We can build custom modules, resources and functions for either your in-house
needs or for your consumer facing product. Make it a pleasure for your own team
to automate, and get customers up and running with your product in seconds.

# Custom Modules

Custom modules are ideal for building a set of intelligent functionality and
automation that glues together the operation of one of more services. They are
written in our `mcl` language.

# Custom Resources

Custom resources are helpful when you want to provide an Mgmt API into your
product. This can be either a software or hardware product, and can allow it to
be more easily used in the Mgmt ecosystem, and augmented by the usefulness of
the Mgmt language and engine.

# Custom Functions

Custom functions allow you to pull data streams into the Mgmt language. This
lets Mgmt integrate all this information and react in real-time to make
decisions on your behalf. These functions can pull in logs and events from your
software or hardware product.
